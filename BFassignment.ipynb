    "The _BrainFuck Programming Language_ (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), henceforth BF for brevity and decency's sake) is a Turing complete programming language that has only eight simple commands.\n",

    "## The question\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal in this assignment is to implement the proof of the Cook Levin Theorem for BF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will need to write a Python function `BF2NAND` such that if `P` is a string describing a BF program and `n` and `t` are integers then `BF2NAND(P,n,t)` will output the code of an $8n$-bit input and one-bit output NAND program $Q$ that satisfies the following. If\n",
    "\n",
    "* `P` is a string which is the source code of a BF program which takes `n` bytes as input. We assume that first instructions of the program are to read these bytes into the memory array (this corresponds to having `n` copies of the pair of instructions `,>`  in the beginning of the program, and having no other `,` instructions in the program).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `t` is an upper bound on the number of steps that the program `P` takes on every input of `n` bytes. Moreover, we assume that the program `P` outputs a single byte, which at the end of the program (which always happen within at most `t` steps) is at the first position of the memory array. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then the output of `BF2NAND(P,n,t)` will be a _NAND program_ $Q$ that takes $8n$ input bits and output a single bit, and has the property that for every $x\\in \\{0,1\\}^{8n}$,  $Q(x)=1$ if and only if the BF program `P`, when given as input the $n$ bytes $x$, outputs a nonzero  byte. \n",
    "\n",
    "(We don't care what the output of `BF2NAND` is if it is given a string that does not code a valid BF program, or that encodes a program that does not satisfy the above assumptions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get 85% of the credit if you restrict yourself to only working for _balanced BF programs_. A BF program is _balanced_  if every loop in it (i.e., everything inside `[...]`) has an equal number of `<` and `>` operations, and so in the end of the loop the data pointer is in the same position that it started."

    "### Some extras\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the last assignment, we might award bonus points to the team that manages to output the shortest NAND programs for a given BF input, though we urge you to first get a working sample before optimizing.  Once again you should remember Knuth's quote _\"Premature optimization is the root of all evil.\"_ \n",
    "\n",
    "While you are guaranteed that no loop in the BF program will iterate more than `t` steps, you might use smarter analysis or benchmarking to get better bounds, and hence output smaller NAND code. For example, you can hardcode certain BF idioms such as `[-]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since [Boaz's repository](https://github.com/boazbk/nandnotebooks/) already contains code that transforms NANDSAT to 3NAND and through there to 3SAT and INDEPENDENT SET, you can combine it with your code to transform a BF program `P` into a graph `G` and a number `k` such that `G` has an independent set of size `k` if and only if there is an input that causes `P` to output `1` within at most `t` steps. Feel free to post images of such graphs (with the BF code that they came from) on Piazza for other students to see and also enclode them in your submission. We might again give some bonus points to particularly impressive images.\n"

Since a BF program actually takes in a char (0-255) for every input, let us treat this as taking the bits into our NAND program with least significant bit first.\n",

    "\n",
    "### BF specification\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the original BF  standard. A specification can be found [here](https://github.com/brain-lang/brainfuck/blob/master/brainfuck.md). BF can be thought of as a tape, where each cell can hold an unsigned 8 bit integer. There are 8 basic instructions.\n",

    "We will treat the `.` as the output of our BF program and the items read in with `,` as the input of our BF program. All of the BF programs we will be testing will read in using `,` sequentially and outputting the first cell on the tape with `.`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The main objective is to convert a BF program with $n$ inputs and $1$ output limited to $t$ operations into a NAND program that takes in $8n$ inputs and $1$ output, where the output of the NAND program is the least significant bit of the first BF output.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Input__: \n",
    "\n",
    "* A BF program that just increments the 8 bit input by 1, and then returns the same. Sample code that does this is as follows (the BF interpreter ignores all of the symbols that aren't in the language) The program can be written as ```,+.```.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Other parameters are $n = 1$, $t = 100$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Output__:\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible output would just be the following NAND program:\n",
    "```\n",
    " y[0] = XOR(x[0], 1)\n",
